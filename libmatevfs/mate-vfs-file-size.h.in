 * This defines MateVFSFileSize and MateVFSFileOffset
 *
 * It also defines MATE_VFS_SIZE_IS_<type> and MATE_VFS_OFFSET_IS_<type>
 * where type is INT, UNSIGNED_INT, LONG, UNSIGNED_LONG, LONG_LONG
 * or UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG.  Note that size is always unsigned and offset
 * is always signed.
 *
 * It also defines MATE_VFS_SIZE_FORMAT_STR and MATE_VFS_OFFSET_FORMAT_STR
 * which is the string representation to be used in printf style expressions.
 * This is without the %, so for example for long it would be "ld"
