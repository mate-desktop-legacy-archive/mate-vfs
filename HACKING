===Commit Permissions==
Build sherrif commits are welcome.

If you are an experienced MATE hacker and confident that your code is right,
you don't need maintainer approval to commit to HEAD. You still need to get your patch
reviewed by some other (competent) MATE hacker.

If you are unsure of your change, please feel free to send the patch to
mate-vfs-list@gnome.org and get our approval so we won't execute you when it breaks
things / does them wrong.

Please get approval for commits to the mate-2-0 branch.


===Prior to Checkin===
Create a ChangeLog entry

Get your code reviewed by an experienced MATE hacker, who's participation you should
cite in the ChangeLog entry by including a "Reviewed by:" line at the top of the entry.

Make sure that any API additions or changes are reflected correctly in the documentation.

Make sure your code does not generate warnings. Do not turn any warnings off, do not
turn -Werror off in configure.in. If you have problems with the existing warnings building
on your environment, please contact the maintainers.

Make sure your changes are properly tested, ammong other things run a "make check".

Please make sure components that depend on Mate VFS (eg Caja, Evolution)
do not break with your change or arrange that an update to the dependent
components gets submitted at the same time.


===Style===
Please use a coding style that is consistent with the existing Mate VFS code.
Mate VFS uses the MATE Programming Guidelines with 8-space tabs and a
"K&R" indentation style.


===FIXMEs===
Use "FIXME" to augument code that needs more work, that is missing functionality or
in general needs attention. Include a comprehensive comment explaining what is
missing, why you think something is broken, what you suggest as a fix, etc.
FIXME entries are periodically converted into bugzilla bugs.
Do not use any other format to draw attention to problems, comments that do
not contain "FIXME" are not going to be found by our problem tracking tools.


===Feedback===
MateVFS bugs and open tasks are tracked in http://bugzilla.gnome.org

For IRC help/feedback use irc.gnome.org/#caja.

A MateVFS mailing list is available at http://lists.gnome.org/
